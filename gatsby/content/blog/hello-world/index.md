The obligatory reference, a clich√© beginning to yet another software developer's blog. After a few days, spread over a few weeks, fighting with Gatsby and GitHub actions (it doesn't seem to like me putting image references in CSS) I'm about ready to start writing stuff. Maybe some of my first posts will be about Gatsby, GitHub Actions, Azure Static Web Apps, or all of the above and that might help someone.

## Dedication

I'd like to dedicate my first blog post to Scott Hanselman. I watched one of his recent talks he gave for the 2021 NDC Melbourne conference on [Mentorship, Storytelling and Sponsorship](https://youtu.be/vjx0lIMamZs). Scott made some very astute points about the value of and better approaches to mentoring, such as lending your privilege - I cannot do his points justice by repeating them in my own words, so I encourage anyone to [watch his talk](https://youtu.be/vjx0lIMamZs).

## Reflections

I really gravitate towards discussions about mentorship. The kind of mentorship where you're walking the path alongside your mentee, I remember some years ago when the company I work for wanted to show recognition and appreciation for employees that demonstrate our values, I saw an opportunity to suggest another trait that we should want to recognise and reward - and so I suggested we have an award for mentorship. It must have been something I was doing well that year, because without solicitation or discussing it with my colleges, my peers voted for me and I handily won the same award I suggested we should have.

Admittedly, it's been some years since I was recognised as formally as that time for my efforts to mentor new and less experienced members joining our team. The opportunity to mentor doesn't always fall neatly on your lap and you have to seek it out. It has been easy for me to let myself be swept up in the moment of playing the hero in projects and while a different kind of recognition comes with blazing the trail on your own, I reflect on some of those times as opportunity costs to bringing others along for the journey.

## Balance

As anyone interested in their own prospects and career can appreciate, there might appear as if there is a balance one must strike between building up others' versus building up yourself. Depending on the type of career path you're wanting to pursue, it might look like there's an opportunity cost to spending your time to nurture someone else's career vs your own. My intuition tells me that this is true in some cases, but more often than not you stand to gain from the experience of being a mentor to others.

It might be paid back in the experience you gain as a communicator, it might exercise and improve your empathy in ways that you don't otherwise experience in the course of your daily work doing peer reviews or pair programming. It might turn into valuable professional relationships that extend beyond teamwork, a deeper connection and trust. It might be paid forward in the form of happy, willing and trustworthy references that support your future career prospects.

Mentorship is a symbiotic relationship that isn't as simple as give and take.
